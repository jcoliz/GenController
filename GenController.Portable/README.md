# GenController.Portable

This project contains all the application logic and helper classes in a portable class library.
Where possible, I've put as much as I can into this portable project.

This has two benefits:
1. Makes it easier to port to another platform
1. Makes it possible to run unit tests using the .NET Framework which is MUCH FASTER than Windows
unit tests.
