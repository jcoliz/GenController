How much common code do I use?

* SimpleMeasurement (only needed for logging. does need to load logs back up)
* IPlatformFileSystem, WindowsFileSystem (used by measurement) -- probably just write a direct .NET logger
* IClock (used throughout)
* ValueConverters
* DelegateCommand
* ViewModelBase
* RangeObservableCollection
* Platform.Get/Set service locator

Plan is to copy these out and/or rework them, so the project can be distributed without ALL my common code base
