# GenController.Portable.ViewModels

This folder contains portable viewmodels which contain the application's interface between the
user and the logic.
These are the domain-specific, but platform-agnostic.

There is one ViewModel for each screen shown to the user. This approach keeps application-specific data
and logic out of the platform-specific app.
